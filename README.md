# Simple-Project-using-Wolfram-Mathematica

This project is an introduction to **Wolfram Mathematica**, using it as a tool to explore foundational topics from Signals and Systems. It involves simulating the core properties of various continuous-time signals to build a strong practical understanding of the theory. The exercises cover signal plotting, energy and power calculations, periodicity, and the mathematical properties of the impulse function.

## **Features**
* Plotting of complex piecewise signals.
* Time-shifting, reversal, and convolution of signals.
* Calculation of signal energy and power.
* Analysis of signal periodicity and fundamental period.
* Solving integrals involving the Dirac delta function.

## **Innovative Aspects**
* **Interactive Signal Analysis:** Uses Mathematica's `Manipulate` command to interactively explore signal properties and verify periodicity.
* **Animated Signal Visualization:** Creates animated GIFs using the `Animate` command to visualize how different functions converge to the Dirac delta function.
* **Theory and Simulation:** Directly compares theoretical results (like periodicity and impulse integrals) with computational results from Mathematica.
